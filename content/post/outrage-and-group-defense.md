## nudge for healthy online communities
[Jaron Lanier suggests
having](https://www.vox.com/2018/1/16/16897738/jaron-lanier-interview)
some _additional_ input or purpose or function to the
community, aside from socializing, as a way to keep a community from turning
into a festering troll swamp. He points to LinkedIn as a social platform that has
managed to avoid a lot of the problems that Twitter and Facebook have, because
its function is for professionals to advance their career. 

Can see this on Codepen, too -- it's hard to troll someone when the only tools
to do so are HTML/CSS/JS.

if it's true that, for every positive online movement there is an equal (or
greater) online backlash, then what systems can a community put in place to
nudge people towards being their best selves?
