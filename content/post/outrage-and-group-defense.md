## who should care about this?
people interested in building online communities (p2p & decentralized groups?)
people who do not like how shitty it is to be on social networks (trolls,
outrage peddlers, bullshit etc) 

## what's the question? 
if it's true that, for every positive online movement there is an equal (or
greater) online backlash, then what incentives can a community put in place to
nudge people towards being their best selves?

Jaron Lanier <p style="color: red; font-size=32px">LINK HERE</p> suggests having
some _additional_ input or purpose or function to the
community, aside from socializing, as a way to keep a community from turning
into a festering troll swamp. He points to LinkedIn as a social platform that has
managed to avoid a lot of the problems that Twitter and Facebook have, because
its function is for professionals to advance their career. 

Can see this on Codepen, too -- it's hard to troll someone when the only tools
to do so are HTML/CSS/JS.
