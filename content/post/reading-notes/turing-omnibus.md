# 58. Predicate Calculus
so much application & business logic I write could be understood in terms of this. 

```python
a = True
b = True

(not (a or b)) == ((not a) and (not b))
```

I've just started the book [The New Turing Omnibus](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805071660/codihorr-20) and I'm excited; looks like it's gonna be fun. I
will add more here as I go through and learn new things!
